<p class="early-life-text ">King was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. (1899–1984) and Alberta Williams King (1904–1974).[1] King's legal name at birth was Michael King, and his father was also born Michael King, but the elder King changed his and his son's names following a 1934 trip to Germany to attend the Fifth Baptist World Alliance Congress in Berlin. It was during this time he chose to be called Martin Luther King in honor of the German reformer Martin Luther.

      <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Education</strong></h3>
  <p class="text-center">Growing up in Atlanta, King attended Booker T. Washington High School. He <br>became known for his public speaking ability and was part of the school's <br>debate team. King became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper <br>delivery station for the Atlanta Journal in 1942 when he was 13.<br> 
    During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by<br> the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia.<br> <br>Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were <br>ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King <br>initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be <br>breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he <br>was "the angriest I have ever been in my life."A precocious student, he <br>skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.

       <p class="text-center">King was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01 p.m., April 4, 1968, as he <br>stood on the motel's second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his <br>right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before <br>lodging in his shoulder.[168][169] Abernathy heard the shot from inside the <br>motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor. Jackson stated <br>after the shooting that he cradled King's head as King lay on the balcony, but <br>this account was disputed by other colleagues of King; Jackson later changed <br>his statement to say that he had "reached out" for King.</p>

    <p class="legacy-text"> King's main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King's assassination, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968.[206] Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.[206]
